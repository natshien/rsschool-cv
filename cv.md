#### About me

I started my journey with IT out of curiosity. At first, I was learning by myself but finally I signed up for IT Bootcamp
and finished the JavaScript module. I like that this branch is very dynamic, focused on innovations and improvement, and always going forward. I feel like choosing this career path gives me more opportunities and more stable position on job market in the future.
I’m impressed by how programming connects creative process with logical thinking, and I’m always interested in learning more about it.

#### English

I've been learning English with great results since primary school, altough I've learnt the most during my university years when I joined ESN community, where beside acting as a section's Webmaster, I was also responsible for organization of events and socializing with foreign students. In that time I was also travelling frequently around the Europe which forced me to practice my language skills even more in real life situation. All that experience was very useful at my various jobs as a stundent and also after my graduation. Currently I've been working in English corporate environment for over 2 years and I feel comfortable with my level of English.
